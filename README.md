## Features

- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with best practices to support growth.
- **GraphQL Support**: Easy integration with GraphQL for flexible API development.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Seamless connection to MongoDB for data storage.
- **TypeScript**: Strong typing for better code quality and maintainability.
- **Modular Design**: Organize your code into modules for better structure.

## Technologies Used

This starter template incorporates the following technologies:

- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for your API, allowing clients to request only the data they need.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nglequduph/nestjs-graphql-mongo-starter.git
cd nestjs-graphql-mongo-starter
npm install
```

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- MongoDB (locally or via a cloud provider)

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set the following variables:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your_database_name
PORT=3000
```

Replace `your_database_name` with the name of your MongoDB database.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several directories:

```
nestjs-graphql-mongo-starter/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ modules/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ user/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ user.module.ts
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ user.service.ts
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ user.resolver.ts
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ user.entity.ts
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.module.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ .env
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

- **modules/**: Contains feature modules for the application.
- **app.module.ts**: The root module that imports other modules.
- **main.ts**: The entry point of the application.

## API Documentation

The API is documented using GraphQL. You can explore the API using the GraphQL Playground available at `http://localhost:3000/graphql` after starting the server.

### Example Queries

Hereâ€™s an example of how to query for users:

```graphql
query {
  users {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

### Example Mutations

To create a new user, you can use the following mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  createUser(name: "John Doe", email: "john@example.com") {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

## Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

This command starts the application in development mode, automatically reloading on file changes.

## Testing

To run the tests, use:

```bash
npm run test
```

This command executes the unit tests defined in the project. Ensure you have a test database set up in your `.env` file.
